# BlackJack-Group-Project
This project was done with: Java, PHP, MySQL, Word, and Excel.

Semester-long project in CS401: Software Engineering with a random group of 3 students in which we had to invent a project, then swap with another groupâ€™s project mid-semester.

I invented the idea of a video game rental system, along with the business plan and technical aspects. My teammates helped with documentation as well as fleshing out the webpage and the database.

Mid-semester, we swapped and took over another group's Blackjack game project, which was a multiplayer GUI based game in Java integrated with a MySQL database for user tracking and PHP website for user registration.

My primary role was to function as a Full Stack Engineer & Project Manager. I worked on the GUI design for the game in Java, created the PHP-based web page, and maintained a database. My teammates assisted in handling the back-end Java coding responsibilities such as fleshing out the game mechanics, and in writing out the documentation to describe how the game would be implemented.
